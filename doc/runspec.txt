*runspec.txt*  Plugin for running specs for the current file

If the current file is a spec, run it; if not, guess where the spec file is and
run that.

This plugin will attempt to detect whether RSpec or a library like minitest is
being used and run the appropriate command either using binstubs if present or
bundle exec.

If the current file is not a spec or test, the plugin will attempt to find the
most appropriate spec or test by taking the current path, changing it to end in
either _spec.rb or _test.rb (depending on the presence of a spec or test
directory) and then searching for that. If nothing comes up, then the plugin
will remove the leading directory and try again, removing directories until only
the file name is left.

e.g. given app/models/user.rb and a spec directory, the plugin will first try
looking for app/models/user_spec.rb anywhere in the current directory. Then it
will try models/user_spec.rb which will successfully find
spec/models/user_spec.rb.

The plugin assumes you are using Bundler to manage dependencies and relies on
searching a valid Gemfile.lock for gems (so it should work even if your Gemfile
only contains "gemspec").
