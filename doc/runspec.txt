*runspec.txt*  Plugin for running specs for the current file

If the current file is a spec, run it; if not, guess where the spec file is and
run that.

This plugin will attempt to detect whether RSpec or a library like minitest is
being used and run the appropriate command.

A very simple mapping is made between a file and its associated spec: the file
name is changed to end in '_spec.rb' and prefixed with 'spec/'. If the path
starts with 'app/' (as it would in a Rails application), this is first stripped.

Mappings:
<Leader>t  or  <Plug>RunSpecRun
  Run the spec for the current file.
